## Submission for the GDSC Solutions Challenge 2022

### Introduction
**GreenBot** is an automated tree plantation robot that targets to provide a solution for the UN Sustainable Development *Goal 13: Climate action* and *Goal 15: Life on Land*.

Our planet’s forests are some of the most valuable resources we have. They provide us with clean air, a source of food, construction material, and much more.

Even more importantly, forests are a major line of defense against climate change. A single tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year - which makes them the most effective CO2 scrubbing machines we have.
Despite this, forests are being systematically eliminated all across the world - a process we know as deforestation. According to the world statistics, each year 15 billion trees are lost to deforestation and forest degradation, which measures up to 36 football fields of trees cut down per minute and accelerating.
At this rate the world's rainforests will be completely gone within a hundred years and this makes deforestation responsible for around 13% of the world's carbon emissions and a major driver of climate change.


Our solution “GreenBot” offers a reliable and an efficient solution to the forementioned problem.
The UN Sustainable development goal 13: Climate action aims to provide Affordable, scalable solutions to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies and the UN sustainable development goal 15: Life on Land aims to sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.

> The main purpose of GreenBot is to reduce the land degradation by planting more trees and thus leading to the decrease in the overall climate change process.
